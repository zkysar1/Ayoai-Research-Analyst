## Research Highlights

Some key areas of investigation include:

- **Behavioral Modeling**: Using ABC (Antecedent-Behavior-Consequence) frameworks for believable agent actions
- **Cognitive Architectures**: Multi-verticle processing systems for complex decision-making
- **Purpose-Driven Behavior**: Goal and motivation systems that drive agent actions
- **Observational Learning**: Agents that learn from watching others
- **Experience Tracking**: Rich internal lives through memory and reflection

## Context

This research explores the intersection of academic theory and practical implementation for creating more sophisticated autonomous agents. While focused on game environments, the concepts extend to any interactive system requiring believable autonomous behavior.

The investigations here represent personal curiosity and exploration into what makes agents feel alive, thoughtful, and genuinely autonomous rather than simply reactive.

### What This Repository (Research Analyst) MUST NOT Do:

**‚ùå Product & Business Decisions**
- Do NOT make product strategy decisions (Product Manager does this)
- Do NOT define business requirements (Business Analyst does this)
- Do NOT set pricing or revenue targets
- Do NOT create product roadmaps or timelines

**‚ùå Implementation Work**
- Do NOT write production code (developers do this)
- Do NOT create technical specifications (Business Analyst does this)
- Do NOT design system architectures without BA coordination
- Do NOT implement features or fixes

**‚ùå Operations & Infrastructure**
- Do NOT deploy code or manage servers
- Do NOT handle AWS infrastructure
- Do NOT manage databases or user data
- Do NOT create or modify Lambda functions

**‚ùå User-Facing Activities**
- Do NOT design UI/UX interfaces
