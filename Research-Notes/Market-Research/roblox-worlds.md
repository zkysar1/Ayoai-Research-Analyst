[The US Military Is Building Its Own Metaverse](https://www.wired.com/story/military-metaverse/) company that develops virtual world, has created sprawling virtual battlefields featuring over 10,000 individually controlled characters for the UK's military wargames, and also works with the US Department of Defense (DOD). "It is an extremely complex type of simulation, especially given the fidelity that the military demands," Dohrman says. "You can either have live players who are participating in the simulation or [characters] can be AI-enabled, which is often what the military does."

**Ayoai Impact**: Military simulations show:
- Scale of 10,000+ AI characters
- High fidelity requirements
- Mix of players and AI agents
- Complex simulation demands

## Roblox-Specific Opportunities

1. **Current State**
   - Most NPCs are simple scripted behaviors
   - Limited interaction capabilities
   - No persistent memory or relationships

2. **Market Opportunity**
   - Tycoon games with intelligent workers
   - RPG games with memorable NPCs
   - Social games with AI companions
   - Educational games with AI tutors

3. **Technical Advantages for Ayoai**
   - Roblox's parallel execution model
   - Actor-based architecture
   - Real-time networking
   - Large player base

4. **Implementation Considerations**
   - Performance constraints
   - Roblox API limitations
   - Cost per NPC
   - Scalability requirements

The military simulation example shows the upper bound of what's possible with large-scale AI character simulation, providing a target for Ayoai's scalability goals.
