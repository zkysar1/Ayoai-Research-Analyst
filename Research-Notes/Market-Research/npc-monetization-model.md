# NPC Monetization Model

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive monetization strategy for the Smart NPC system, creating multiple revenue streams while enhancing player engagement and NPC autonomy.

## Core Monetization Concepts

**Concept**: Players can create, buy, and sell custom purpose bars (life goals/motivations) for NPCs.

**Examples**:
- Seasonal bars: "Skiing enthusiasm" (peaks in winter)
- Career bars: "Work satisfaction," "Professional growth"
- Hobby bars: "Gaming addiction," "Fitness goals"
- Social bars: "Popularity," "Family bonds"

**Revenue Model**:
- Creator earns 70% of sales
- Platform takes 30% commission
- Featured bars get premium placement
- Subscription for unlimited bar access

**Value Proposition**:
- Easy creation interface (search, add, configure)
- Pre-tested bar packages
- Community ratings and reviews
- Automatic balancing algorithms

### 2. Antecedent Packs

**Concept**: Pre-built behavioral patterns that teach NPCs new reactions and behaviors.
