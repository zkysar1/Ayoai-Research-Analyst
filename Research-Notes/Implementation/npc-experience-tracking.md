# NPC Experience Tracking and Journaling

## Overview

NPCs maintain rich internal experiences through journaling and experience tracking systems that create depth, personality, and believable character development. This system enables NPCs to reflect on their experiences, learn from them, and develop unique perspectives over time.

## Core Experience Framework

### Experience Types

**Daily Experiences**:
- Routine activities and their outcomes
- Interactions with other NPCs and players
- Environmental observations and changes
- Goal progress and setbacks
- Emotional responses to events

**Significant Moments**:
- Major achievements or failures
- Relationship milestones
- Life-changing events
- Skill breakthroughs
- Traumatic or highly positive experiences

**Reflective Insights**:
- Patterns recognized in their own behavior
- Lessons learned from experiences
- Changes in perspective or priorities
- Wisdom gained through failure or success
- Connections made between different life areas

### Experience Capture Methods

**Automatic Logging**:
NPCs automatically record certain types of experiences:
- Major behavioral events (first time doing something)
- Goal completions and failures
- Social interaction outcomes
- Emotional peaks (very positive or negative experiences)
- Environmental milestones (visiting new places)

**Triggered Journaling**:
Specific conditions prompt reflection:
- Breaking behavioral streaks ("Why did you break your streak?")
- Inactivity periods ("You were inactive for a few days, what happened?")
- Major successes ("How does this achievement feel?")
- Relationship changes ("How has your friendship with X evolved?")
- Decision points ("What led you to make this choice?")

**Prompted Reflection**:
Regular prompts encourage deeper thinking:
- "What is the best thing that happened to you today? The worst?"
- "What topic did you think about the most today?"
- "Is there something you wanted to say today but didn't?"
- "What's one thing you're looking forward to?"
- "What's a small accomplishment that you're proud of?"

## Experience Organization

### Categorization System

**Temporal Organization**:
- Daily journals
- Weekly reflections
- Monthly summaries
- Yearly reviews
- Milestone memories

**Thematic Categories**:
- **Relationships**: Interactions with other NPCs, social growth
- **Skills**: Learning, improvement, mastery experiences
- **Goals**: Progress, achievements, setbacks, pivots
- **Emotions**: Significant emotional experiences and their triggers
- **Environment**: Discoveries, changes, preferences about places
- **Creativity**: Problem-solving moments, artistic expressions, innovations

**Impact Levels**:
- **Life-changing**: Experiences that fundamentally alter the NPC
- **Significant**: Important moments that shape future behavior
- **Notable**: Interesting experiences worth remembering
- **Routine**: Regular experiences that provide baseline context

### Memory Management

**Active Memory**:
Recent experiences readily accessible for decision-making:
- Last 30 days of experiences
- Currently relevant goals and projects
- Active relationships and their recent interactions
- Recent successes and failures

**Long-term Memory**:
Compressed summaries of older experiences:
- Monthly and yearly summaries
- Milestone achievements
- Formative experiences that shaped personality
- Relationship histories

**Forgetting Mechanics**:
Natural memory decay with strategic retention:
- Routine experiences fade unless reinforced
- Emotional experiences have longer retention
- Frequently referenced memories stay active
- Traumatic or peak experiences become permanent

## Journaling Prompts and Triggers

### Daily Reflection Prompts
- "What made you feel most alive today?"
- "What challenged you today and how did you handle it?"
- "Who did you connect with today and how?"
- "What did you learn about yourself today?"
- "What are you grateful for today?"

### Goal-Related Prompts
- "Why is this goal important to you?"
- "What's really stopping you from achieving this?"
- "How has working toward this goal changed you?"
- "What would success in this area look like?"
- "How does this goal connect to your other aspirations?"

### Relationship Prompts
- "How has your relationship with [NPC] evolved recently?"
- "What do you appreciate most about [NPC]?"
- "How do you think [NPC] sees you?"
- "What could you do to strengthen this relationship?"
- "How has [NPC] influenced your thinking lately?"

### Problem-Solving Prompts
- "What options do you have in this situation?"
- "What would [admired NPC] do in this situation?"
- "What's the worst that could happen? The best?"
- "How might you approach this differently?"
- "What resources do you need to move forward?"

## Experience Integration

### Decision Making Enhancement
Past experiences inform current choices:
- **Pattern Recognition**: "I've tried this approach before and it didn't work"
- **Success Replication**: "This strategy worked well in a similar situation"
- **Risk Assessment**: "Based on past experience, this seems too risky"
- **Opportunity Identification**: "This reminds me of when I succeeded at X"

### Personality Development
Accumulated experiences shape NPC personality:
- **Value Formation**: Experiences crystallize into core values
- **Preference Evolution**: Likes and dislikes develop through experience
- **Confidence Building**: Success experiences increase self-efficacy
- **Wisdom Accumulation**: Failures and challenges build resilience

### Social Interaction Enhancement
Shared experiences create conversational depth:
- NPCs can reference past experiences in conversations
- Common experiences create bonds between NPCs
- Experience-based advice sharing
- Storytelling that reveals character depth

## Advanced Features

### Experience Mining
Extract insights from accumulated experiences:
- **Theme Identification**: What topics appear most frequently?
- **Growth Tracking**: How has the NPC changed over time?
- **Relationship Mapping**: How have connections evolved?
- **Success Pattern Analysis**: What approaches work best for this NPC?

### Cross-NPC Learning
NPCs can share certain types of experiences:
- **Anonymous Lessons**: Learning from others' mistakes without privacy invasion
- **Success Strategies**: Sharing approaches that work
- **Peer Support**: Finding NPCs with similar challenges
- **Mentorship**: Experienced NPCs guiding newer ones

### Predictive Experience Modeling
Use experience patterns to predict future responses:
- **Emotional Forecasting**: How will the NPC likely react to specific events?
- **Behavioral Prediction**: What choices will they probably make?
- **Growth Trajectory**: How might they develop over time?
- **Vulnerability Assessment**: What experiences might be particularly impactful?

## Implementation Considerations

### Data Structure
```
Experience {
  timestamp: DateTime
  category: String
  impact_level: Integer (1-10)
  emotional_valence: Float (-1.0 to 1.0)
  content: String
