# Decision Augmentation for NPCs

## Overview

Decision augmentation represents the systematic approach to helping NPCs make better decisions by leveraging historical data, behavioral patterns, and predictive analytics. This system transforms raw experience data into actionable insights that guide NPC behavior choices.

## Core Concept

**"Whatever task has the most points and written enough reasons, good or bad, then it creates action."**

NPCs use accumulated evidence and reasoning to make decisions rather than relying solely on immediate stimuli. This creates more thoughtful, consistent, and believable character behaviors.

## Decision Framework

### 1. Reason Tracking System

NPCs maintain detailed reasoning for their goals and behaviors:

**Structure**:
- **Why do I have this goal?** - Core motivation tracking
- **What's in my way?** - Obstacle identification
- **What helps this goal?** - Supporting factor recognition
- **Past consequences** - Historical outcome analysis

**Examples**:
- Goal: "Exercise daily"
- Reasons: "Back pain improvement", "Energy increase", "Stress reduction"
- Obstacles: "Bad weather", "Work overtime", "Lack of motivation"
- Supporters: "Morning routine", "Workout buddy", "Good sleep"

### 2. Points-Based Weighting

Each decision factor accumulates points based on:
- **Frequency of success/failure**
- **Intensity of consequences**
- **Recency of experience**
- **Emotional impact**
- **External validation**

### 3. Evidence Threshold

NPCs only act when sufficient evidence supports the decision:
- **Minimum reason count**: Must have multiple supporting factors
- **Quality threshold**: Reasons must be substantive, not superficial
- **Confidence level**: Accumulated points must exceed action threshold

## Decision Categories

### Immediate Decisions (Fast Triggers)
- Life-threatening situations
- Opportunity windows
- Social responses
- Emergency reactions

**Process**: Direct pattern matching to established responses

### Deliberative Decisions (Slow Triggers)
- Goal prioritization
- Long-term planning
- Relationship choices
- Career/skill development

**Process**: Full decision augmentation analysis

### Habitual Decisions
- Daily routines
- Established patterns
- Comfort behaviors
- Maintenance activities

**Process**: Automated based on historical success patterns

## Implementation Architecture

### Data Collection
NPCs continuously gather decision-relevant data:
- **Personal Experience**: Direct outcome tracking
- **Observational Learning**: Watching others' successes/failures
- **Environmental Factors**: Context that affects outcomes
- **Social Feedback**: Validation or criticism from other NPCs

### Analysis Engine
Real-time processing of decision factors:
```
Decision Score = (Σ Reason Points × Importance Weight × Recency Factor) 
                 - (Σ Obstacle Points × Severity Weight)
                 + Environmental Bonus/Penalty
```

### Action Trigger
Execute behavior when:
1. Decision score exceeds threshold
2. Minimum reason count met
3. No critical obstacles present
4. Environmental conditions favorable

## Advanced Features

### Predictive Decision Support
- **Failure Prevention**: Identify decisions likely to fail before making them
- **Optimal Timing**: Suggest best moments for specific actions
- **Resource Allocation**: Balance competing goals and limited resources
- **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate potential negative consequences

### Social Decision Making
- **Peer Influence**: Factor in social pressure and expectations
- **Relationship Impact**: Consider effect on bonds with other NPCs
- **Reputation Management**: Maintain consistent character image
- **Collaborative Goals**: Coordinate decisions with allied NPCs

### Adaptive Learning
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify successful decision strategies
- **Context Sensitivity**: Adjust approach based on situation type
- **Personal Growth**: Evolve decision-making style over time
- **Error Correction**: Learn from poor decisions

## Decision Augmentation Tools

### Reason Database
Centralized repository of decision factors:
- **Personal reasons**: Individual motivations and preferences
- **Universal reasons**: Common human drives and needs
- **Cultural reasons**: Context-specific social factors
- **Situational reasons**: Environment-dependent considerations

### Decision Templates
Pre-built frameworks for common choices:
- **Goal Setting**: How to choose new objectives
- **Conflict Resolution**: Handling interpersonal disputes
- **Resource Management**: Allocating time, energy, money
- **Risk Taking**: Deciding when to try something new

### Outcome Tracking
Systematic measurement of decision results:
- **Short-term consequences**: Immediate effects
- **Long-term outcomes**: Extended impact analysis
- **Side effects**: Unintended consequences
- **Satisfaction metrics**: How the NPC feels about the choice

## Integration with Purpose Bars

Decision augmentation directly interfaces with the purpose bar system:

1. **Goal Generation**: Create new purpose bars based on decision analysis
2. **Priority Adjustment**: Modify importance weights based on outcomes
3. **Frequency Optimization**: Adjust goal timing based on success patterns
4. **Conflict Resolution**: Handle competing goals through reasoned analysis

## Machine Learning Applications

### Pattern Mining
- **Success Factors**: Identify conditions that lead to good decisions
- **Failure Modes**: Recognize patterns that predict poor choices
- **Personal Styles**: Learn individual NPC decision preferences
- **Environmental Effects**: Understand context impact on choices

### Predictive Modeling
- **Outcome Forecasting**: Predict likely results before deciding
- **Behavior Simulation**: Test decisions in virtual scenarios
- **Risk Calculation**: Quantify potential negative consequences
- **Optimization**: Find best decision paths for complex situations

## Ayoai Impact

Decision augmentation transforms NPCs from reactive entities to proactive, thoughtful characters:

1. **Believable Behavior**: NPCs make decisions for understandable reasons
2. **Character Consistency**: Decisions align with established personality and goals
3. **Player Engagement**: Players can understand and influence NPC reasoning
4. **Emergent Storytelling**: Complex narratives arise from NPC decision chains
5. **Educational Value**: Players learn decision-making strategies from NPC examples

This system enables NPCs that don't just react to the world, but actively shape it through thoughtful, evidence-based choices.
