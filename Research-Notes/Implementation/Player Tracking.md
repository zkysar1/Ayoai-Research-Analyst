## Player Tracking

Player actions and their behavior trees are essential for enabling meaningful multi-agent interaction. Tracking player behavior serves dual purposes: driving more realistic NPC responses and potentially training large action models for commercial use or internal optimization.

### Implementation Considerations
- Convert player inputs (keystrokes, mouse movements) into a standardized internal canonical form for consistent processing
- Develop comprehensive player tracking systems that capture all meaningful player movements and interactions
- Reference successful control schemes from games like OMNI-EPIC and goal-based interaction systems

- Include contextual interaction systems (e.g., "E to interact") for more intuitive player-NPC engagement
