- [ ] **The use of embeddings by models has also grown rapidly, driven by the growing demand for semantic understanding, whether through NLP, computer vision, or recommendation systems. This motivated us to build out a vector database to efficiently store and retrieve vectors as high-dimensional points. The vector database has enabled fast nearest neighbor lookups to power capabilities such as multimodal search and content violation detection.**

  > 📝 https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2019.0751

    - [ ] **In the case of decision-making, the core elements are: (1) selecting between alternatives based on making measurements of both internal and external conditions and (2) evaluating those by means of norms embodied in the control mechanism, which are ultimately rooted in the maintenance of the organism.**
    - [ ] **Main take!!  mechanisms are systems of constraints that restrict the flow of free energy to perform work.  Constraints restrict what movements are possible.  However, as Hooker [26] makes clear, constraints also open up possibilities—water constrained by a pipe can reach a destination much further away than if it is not so constrained.**
    - [ ] **The operations of a control mechanism in turn can be modulated by other control mechanisms that operate on flexible constraints in the first control mechanism. Multiple control mechanisms can be assembled into an architecture capable of determining multiple different specific responses as needed to maintain the complex biological organization constituting an organism.**
